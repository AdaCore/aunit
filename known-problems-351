The following is a listing of known problems in release 3.5.1. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the development
tree of the 3.6 technology. This means they are corrected in any 3.6.0w
wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD)
in the status line. This can be used to determine if a given wavefront has
the fix identified in the entry.

M105-007 Exception raised in full ravenscar are not correctly displayed

When using Aunit with a full ravenscar profile, AUnit is incorrectly assuming
that the runtime does not support exception propagation, and is thus using the
low-level setjmp longjmp mechanism used in zfp support.

Workaround: modify aunit_shared.gpr so that "ravenscar" profile uses
  "certexception"
