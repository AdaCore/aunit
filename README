AUnit 2.01 README
October 3, 2006

This is a major update release of the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived
from the JUnit framework for Java.  Read docs/aunit.html for usage.


Installation:
-------------

Extract the archive into <build-dir>.

* To build and install AUnit for a full Ada run-time:

   $ cd <build-dir>
   $ make INSTALL=<gnat-root> install

   Where <gnat-root> is for example /opt/gnatpro/5.04a1

   At this point AUnit will be automatically available. It is just required to
   with the "aunit" project into the application project.

* Specific installation:

   The AUnit makefile supports some specific options, activated using
   environment variables. The following options are defined:

   INSTALL: defines the AUnit base installation directory, should always be
    set.

   TOOL_PREFIX: defines the gnat tools prefix to use. For example, to compile
    AUnit for powerpc VxWorks, TOOLS_PREFIX should be set to
    powerpc-wrs-vxworks. If not set, the native compiler will be used.

   RTS: defines the run-time used to compile AUnit. When set to zfp, this
    automatically defines SUPPORT_CALENDAR and SUPPORT_EXCEPTION (see below).

   SUPPORT_CALENDAR: takes the values yes (default) or no. If the compiler or
    the run-time used do not provide Ada.Calendar, then you should set this
    variable to 'no'.

   SUPPORT_EXCEPTION: takes the values yes (default) or no. If the compiler or
    the run-time used do not provide exceptions support, then you should set
    this variable to 'no'.

   Example:

   To install AUnit to /opt/gnatpro/5.04a1, for a cross ppc vxworksae compiler,
   using a zfp run-time, you need to type
   $ cd <build-dir>
   $ make INSTALL=/opt/gnatpro/5.04a1 RTS=zfp \
       TOOL_PREFIX=powerpc-wrs-vxworksae install

* To test AUnit:

   The AUnit test suite is in the test subdirectory. In order to build and
   run the AUnit test suite, first install the AUnit library, then:
   $ cd test
   $ make

   The test suite's makefile support the following variables:
   * RTS
   * TOOL_PREFIX


Other compilers:
----------------

Currently AUnit is written to work with the open source GNAT Ada compilation
system.  To that end, GNAT project files have been provided.  For other
compilation systems, the sources in aunit/* must be made accessible
to the compilation system according to its conventions.
