AUnit README

This is the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived
from the JUnit/CPPUnit frameworks for Java/C++. Read the AUnit Cookbook,
available in doc/ in a number of formats, for installation and usage.

AUnit is maintained by AdaCore. Please report problems at report@adacore.com

NOTE FOR CONTRIBUTORS
---------------------

AUnit is intended to be used on bareboard targets that have a very
limited runtime library, so many things like containers, finalization,
exception propagation and so on cannot be used in the main framework
unconditionally. For full list of restrictions see following parts of
GNAT Userâ€™s Guide Supplement for Cross Platforms:

* [4.2.2. Ada Restrictions in the Zero Footprint Profile](http://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gnat_ugx/html/gnat_ugx/gnat_ugx/the_predefined_profiles.html#ada-restrictions-in-the-zero-footprint-profile)

* [4.2.3. Predefined Packages in the Zero Footprint Profile](http://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gnat_ugx/html/gnat_ugx/gnat_ugx/the_predefined_profiles.html#predefined-packages-in-the-zero-footprint-profile)

Other language features and predefined packages may be used in conditional
way, by either providing the same API across different scenarios or adding
new units for full runtime scenario only. An example of such conditional usage
is FileIO variable from lib/gnat/aunit_shared.gpr that selects between
include/aunit/framework/fileio and include/aunit/framework/nofileio.
