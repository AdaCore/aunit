AUnit 2.02 README
March 26th, 2007

This is a minor update release of the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived
from the JUnit framework for Java. Read docs/aunit.html for installation and
usage.

Other compilers:
----------------

Currently AUnit is written to work with the open source GNAT Ada compilation
system.  To that end, GNAT project files have been provided.  For other
compilation systems, the sources in aunit/* must be made accessible
to the compilation system according to its conventions.
Note that AUnit also uses the GNAT.IO package. This package should then be also
made available.

Changes:
--------

2.02: Documentation additions and modifications. Allow usage of no_fixed_point
      restriction.

2.01: Modify the AUnit_Framework.Framework generic arguments for ease of use
      purpose.

2.00: Major rewrite. Adapt the framework to allow limited run-times.
