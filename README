AUnit 2.01 README
January 9, 2007

This is a major update release of the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived
from the JUnit framework for Java.  Read docs/aunit.html for installation and usage.

Other compilers:
----------------

Currently AUnit is written to work with the open source GNAT Ada compilation
system.  To that end, GNAT project files have been provided.  For other
compilation systems, the sources in aunit/* must be made accessible
to the compilation system according to its conventions.
Note that AUnit also uses the GNAT.IO package. This package should then be also
made available.
