AUnit 3.1.0w README
April 1st, 2008

This is a major update release of the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived

installation and usage.

Changes:
--------

3.00: Major rewrite:
      - Removal of the genericity of the AUnit framework.
      - Replace it by dynamic allocation emulation on platforms with limited
        run-time (zero footprint, cert), using kind of a Storage Pool.
      - Provide a new XML reporter, modify the way a harness is run to allow
        easy switch between Text, XML or customized reporters.
      - Provide the following new tagged types: Simple_Test_Case, Test_Fixture,
        Test_Caller matching CPPUnit's TestCase, TestFixture and TestCaller
        classes.
      - On ZFP runtimes, use gcc builtin setjmp/longjmp mechanism to emulate
        exception propagation.
      - Report error locations when available.

2.02: Documentation additions and modifications. Allow usage of no_fixed_point
      restriction.

2.01: Modify the AUnit_Framework.Framework generic arguments for ease of use
