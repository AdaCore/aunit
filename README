AUnit 2.01 README
3 October 2006

This is a major update release of the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived
from the JUnit framework for Java.  Read AUnit.html for usage.


Installation:
-------------

Extract the archive into <build-dir>.

* To build and install AUnit for a full Ada run-time:

   $ cd <build-dir>
   $ make
   $ make INSTALL=<gnat-root> install

   Where <gnat-root> is for example /opt/gnatpro/5.04a1

   At this point AUnit will be automatically available. It is just required to
   with the "aunit" project into the application project.

* To test AUnit:

   $ make test

* ZFP support library:

   AUnit for a ZFP GNAT run-time requires a support library implementing a
   last chance handler, and providing Gnat.IO package. To build and install
   this support library:

   $ cd <build-dir>
   $ make -f makefile.zfp_support
   $ make -f makefile.zfp_support INSTALL=<gnat-root> install

* To build and install AUnit for a ZFP GNAT run-time:

   $ cd <build-dir>
   $ make zfp
   $ make INSTALL=<gnat-root> install-zfp

* To test AUnit in ZFP mode:

   $ make test-zfp

Currently AUnit is written to work with the open source GNAT Ada compilation
system.  To that end, GNAT project files have been provided.  For other
compilation systems, the sources in aunit/* must be made accessible
to the compilation system according to its conventions.
