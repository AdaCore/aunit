AUnit 1.0 README
24 September 2000

This is the first release of the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived from 
the JUnit framework for Java.  Read AUnit.html for usage.


Installation:

Unzip the archive into <install-dir>.  Build and run <install-dir>/aunit-1.0/test/harness.adb to verify that it works.


Directories contain the following:

aunit/*    - The framework and a simple text mode reporter of results.
template/* - Templates for unit tests, a test harness, and a GLIDE project
             file.
tests/*    - A set of unit tests for testing the framework itself (in progress)

Currently AUnit is written to work with the open source GNAT Ada compilation
system.  To that end, GLIDE project files have been provided.  For other 
compilation systems, the sources in aunit-1.0/aunit/* must be made accessible
to the compilation system according to its conventions.


Switches:

Any test harness using AUnit.Test_Results.Text_Reporter can be invoked with
the following command syntax:

test_harness [ -v | -V ]

-v : Verbose mode.  Lists all tests executed.  When not specified, only failed
     and error tests are listed.


To do:

1. Memory management for Test_Cases and Test_Suites. Lists are done.
2. GUI.
