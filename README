AUnit 1.01 README
29 November 2000

This is a minor update release of the Ada unit test framework AUnit, derived 
from the JUnit framework for Java.  Read AUnit.html for usage.


Installation:

Unzip the archive into <install-dir>.  Build and run <install-dir>/aunit-1.0/test/harness.adb to verify that it works.


Directories contain the following:

aunit/*    - The framework and a simple text mode reporter of results.
template/* - Templates for unit tests, a test harness, and a GLIDE project
             file.
tests/*    - A set of unit tests for testing the framework itself (in progress)

Currently AUnit is written to work with the open source GNAT Ada compilation
system.  To that end, GLIDE project files have been provided.  For other 
compilation systems, the sources in aunit-1.0/aunit/* must be made accessible
to the compilation system according to its conventions.


Switches:

Any test harness using AUnit.Test_Results.Text_Reporter can be invoked with
the following command syntax:

test_harness [ -v | -V ]

-v : Verbose mode.  Lists all tests executed.  When not specified, only failed
     and error tests are listed.

Changes:
1.01	1. Added Test_Case'Class parameter to test routines, allowing access to
	Test_Case per-instance data.  This may be useful for derived Test_Case
	instances, as an alternative to using global package body data.

	2. Changed the profile of AUnit.Test_Runner to:
		procedure AUnit.Test_Runner (Timed : Boolean := True);
	This allows suppression of timing reporting so that the output
	of running a harness can be identical across runs.  Useful for
	scripted regression tests, where the output of a harness run is
	compared against a reference file.

	3. Implemented remaining memory management for the framework.  There
	should be no memory leaks now (checked with gnatmem).

	4. Corrected error in AUnit.Lists.Put_Right, where the list wasn't
	being chained correctly.

	5. Added Set_Up and Tear_Down routines to AUnit.Lists tests.

To do:

	1. GUI integration.
