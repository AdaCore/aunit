The GPS IDE relies on the `gnattest` tool that creates unit-test skeletons as well as
a test driver infrastructure (harness). A harness can be generated for a project
hierarchy, a single project or a package. The generation process can be launched
from the `Tools` -> `GNATtest` menu or from a contextual menu.
