.. index:: GNAT Studio support

The GNAT Studio IDE relies on the `gnattest` tool that creates unit-test
skeletons as well as a test driver infrastructure (harness). A harness can be
generated for a project hierarchy, a single project or a package.
The generation process can be launched from the `Analyze` -> `GNATtest` menu
or from a contextual menu.
