This file contains information about the various steps required for producing
a new AUnit release, and testing it:

 -------------------
/ Release process /
------------------

* verify the version number in version_information, README, configure.ac

* verify the copyright notice in docs/aunit.texi

* review the README for content, changelog. Verify the date is correct.

* preform a Sanity-checking for linux native, windows native,
  windows native using zfp runtime, cross ppc-vxworks on both linux and
  windows.

* put a tag in the CVS repository corresponding to the sources used by the
  release:
  $cvs tag aunit-2_02

* switch nightly builds to use the branch by modifying the aunit line in
  'build-tags' (from scripts/nightly CVS repository), and update this script
  on nile, e.g:

  aunit        aunit-2_02

* verify that aunit installs correctly on all supported platforms.

* redo the sanity-checking

 -------------------
/ Sanity-checking /
------------------

for Native and cross-platforms, non Windows platforms.

* verify that AUnit can be compiled and installed correctly
  (non Windows platform case).

    $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
    $ make install

  For cross compiler, use
    $ make install TOOL_PREFIX=<gnat tools prefix>
  For compilation with a ZFP run-time, use
    $ make install RTS=zfp

  If the installation directory is not GNAT's directory, you need to set
  ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment variable to <prefix>/lib/gnat


* verify that AUnit can be compiled and installed correctly
  (Windows case).

  Make sure that the GNAT compiler you want to use has been installed using
  the InstallShield.

  Make sure that this compiler is *not* in the PATH.

  Use the install-shield to install AUnit, verify that it is correctly compiled
  and installed.


* review the documentation
  Verify that the documentation is correctly installed in
  <prefix>/share/doc/aunit
  In particular, make sure that pdf, txt, html, info formats are available, and
  that the pdf version is properly formatted.

  If the installation directory is not GPS's directory, you need to set
  GPS_CUSTOM_PATH to <prefix>/share/gps/plug-ins

  Launch gps and verify that the menu Help->AUnit->AUnit User's Guide exists
  and correctly launches an explorer with aunit.html document.


* verify that the aunit examples can be directly loaded by GPS, and can be
  compiled without error:

    $ cd <prefix>/share/examples/aunit
    $ gps -Psample
  Then press F4 to compile.


* verify that the test suite can be compiled, and can be executed. Verify that
  the results are clean: errors displayed should tell that they are expected.

   $ cd <src dir>/test
   $ make

  Note that TOOL_PREFIX and RTS must be used here with the same values as when
  compiling.
