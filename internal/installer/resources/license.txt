                             GNAT PRO LICENSE

GNAT Pro, including the GNU components that it uses, are distributed
subject to the GPL (General Public License).  This means that GNAT Pro can
be freely used and copied for use by programmers on the supported project.

The programs generated by GNAT Pro may include runtime library code, either
as a result of static or dynamic linking, or as a result of generic
instantiation. Such inclusion does not cause the resulting program to be
covered by the GPL, since all library units are distributed subject to a
modified license consisting of the GPL together with the following
exception paragraph:

  As a special exception, if other files instantiate generics from
  this unit, or you link this unit with other files to produce an
  executable, this unit does not by itself cause the resulting
  executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.  This
  exception does not however, invalidate any other reasons why the
  executable file might be covered by the GNU Public License.

The C components in the runtime (called the GCC run-time support code) have
a similar exception clause:

  As a special exception, if you link this library with other files,
  some of which are compiled with GCC, to produce an executable, this
  library does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be
  covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
  however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might
  be covered by the GNU General Public License.
 
In the case of C, there is no need to include the clause on instantiations,
since C lacks this language feature.

The consequence of this exception is that the runtime can be freely used
without limiting in any way your rights to control the distribution of the
resulting program. The statement made in this letter overrides whatever
license which you can find at the beginning of GNAT Pro sources and we
hereby guarantee that all programs generated by the GNAT Pro version
received from Ada Core Technologies and ACT Europe may be proprietary, or
classified as secret, or be subject to any other distribution restrictions
that you deem appropriate.
